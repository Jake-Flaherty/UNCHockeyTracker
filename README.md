# UNCHockeyTracker

1. Use:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   or
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

2. run the gui.py file with:
   python gui.py
   or
   python3 gui.py

3. Use the commands listed on the side of the screen to impact what goes into the dataframes
     examples: (FOW7, FO12, S18, TOO22, or H28)

4. Once you are done with the program press the save button it will create two files
   (Hint: they may not have the file extension .csv by default so you may have to add it)

5. These files contain any change to the individual stats you need to make AND all the stats coach wants from the games.

6. After the game these will get put into a google sheet that will be stored in this same github repo

7. If any of this does not make sense OR stuff simply does not work text/call Jake Flaherty

THINGS LEFT TO ADD:
[] period by period data instead of full game

[] error handling (if you somehow make an error you lose all data you haven't saved)

[] change stats on screen by period not just full game
